Following that, the AI posed two questions to the user regarding their preferences for the template: what specific colors or color themes they envisioned, offering options of \"Bright and vibrant colors\" or \"Pastel and soft colors,\" and whether they preferred a minimalistic design or a more complex and detailed layout, providing the same two options for each. The AI noted the status of the interaction, input and output token counts, and the time taken for the response.\nUser: Add a nice image of a TRex, Implement a colorful background template, Design a user-friendly main menu\nAI: Sure, I'm on it for the TRex image, colorful background, and user-friendly menu.\nUser: add a nice image of a TRex\nAI: Okay, I will add a nice image of a T-Rex.\n\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made:\nAdd animations to the main menu transitions, Integrate customizable character options"

The user was also asked two questions regarding their vision for the T-Rex image and placement, offering options for both realistic versus cartoonish styles and background versus character positioning. Additionally, the user requested a colorful template, prompting the AI to again acknowledge it and confirm they were working on that feature. Another round of questions followed regarding color themes and design complexity for the template, affirming the user's preferences for a vibrant color palette and a minimalist design.\nUser: geneate a title\nUser: Add animations to the main menu transitions, Integrate customizable character options\nAI: Absolutely, adding animations and customizable character options now.\nUser: Add a nice image of a TRex, Implement a colorful background template, Design a user-friendly main menu\nAI: Sure, I'm on it for the TRex image, colorful background, and user-friendly menu.\n\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made:\nADD TITILE HERE"
